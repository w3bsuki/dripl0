# Image Caching Strategy for Driplo

## Current Implementation

### Storage Layer (Supabase Storage)
- Images stored in Supabase Storage buckets with 1-year cache headers
- WebP format for optimal compression and quality
- Multiple sizes generated on upload (thumb, small, medium, large)
- CDN-backed storage with global edge caching

### Optimization Benefits
1. **WebP Format**: 25-35% smaller than JPEG/PNG with same quality
2. **Responsive Images**: Different sizes for different devices
3. **Long Cache Headers**: Browser caches images for 1 year
4. **CDN Distribution**: Images served from nearest edge location

## Do We Need Redis?

### Current Caching Layers
1. **Browser Cache**: 1-year cache headers on all images
2. **CDN Cache**: Supabase Storage uses Cloudflare CDN
3. **Service Worker**: Can add offline support if needed

### Redis Would Be Overkill Because:
1. **Images are static**: Once uploaded, they don't change
2. **URLs are permanent**: No need to cache URL mappings
3. **CDN handles distribution**: Global edge caching already in place
4. **Browser caching is effective**: Users rarely re-download same images

### When Redis Would Be Useful:
- Dynamic image transformations (we do this on upload)
- Temporary image URLs (we use permanent URLs)
- High-frequency metadata queries (we store in DB)
- Session-based image access (our images are public/permanent)

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading (Already Implemented)
```svelte
<ResponsiveImage 
  src={image.url}
  alt={image.alt}
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### 2. Progressive Loading
- Show blurred placeholder while loading
- Already using skeleton loaders

### 3. Preload Critical Images
- Hero images
- Above-the-fold content
```html
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/hero.webp">
```

### 4. Service Worker (Future Enhancement)
```javascript
// Cache images for offline access
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.destination === 'image') {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
        return response || fetch(event.request);
      })
    );
  }
});
```

## Conclusion

**Redis is NOT needed** for image caching. The current implementation with:
- Supabase Storage + CDN
- WebP optimization
- Responsive images
- Browser caching

Provides excellent performance without additional complexity.

## Performance Metrics
- **First Load**: ~200-400ms (CDN cold start)
- **Cached Load**: ~10-20ms (browser cache)
- **Global Access**: <100ms (CDN edge servers)
