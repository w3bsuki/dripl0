## Development Principles

### 1. PLAN - Think Before Acting
Always create a clear plan before implementation. Break complex problems into smaller tasks.

### 2. ANALYZE - Understand the System
Read existing code and migrations before making changes. Check for patterns and impacts.

### 3. EXECUTE - Implement Cleanly
- No duplicates: Check if functionality exists
- No bloat: Write only what's necessary
- Keep it simple: Avoid overengineering
- No tech debt: Fix issues properly

### 4. VERIFY - Test Your Changes
Always verify migrations and code changes work correctly. Check for side effects.

### 5. ITERATE - Continuous Improvement
Review implementations, identify issues early, and refactor when needed.

## Mobile-First Approach
- Compact card views for product listings
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Haptic feedback support
- Progressive image loading

## Internationalization Status
- **Languages**: English (default), Bulgarian
- **Coverage**: 161 translation keys implemented
- **Framework**: Paraglide JS with type safety
- **Remaining**: ~100 keys for new features

## Security Considerations
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Secure file upload policies
- API rate limiting needed
- Input validation throughout
- XSS protection implemented

## Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Lighthouse Score: > 90
- Bundle Size: < 500KB initial

## Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: Local Supabase + Vercel preview
2. **Staging**: Supabase staging + Vercel staging
3. **Production**: Supabase pro + Vercel production
4. **Monitoring**: Sentry, Vercel Analytics

## Budget Estimate
- **Development**: $40,000 - $60,000
- **Infrastructure**: $200-500/month
- **Third-party Services**: $300-500/month
- **Total First Year**: $50,000 - $70,000

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Set up Stripe development account
2. Implement basic payment flow
3. Complete chat UI implementation
4. Add order creation system
5. Begin beta testing program

## Success Metrics
- 1,000 active users in first 3 months
