## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database schema changes**: All migrations tested in development first
2. **Payment processing**: Comprehensive webhook handling and idempotency
3. **Real-time features**: Graceful fallback to polling if WebSocket fails

### Business Risks
1. **User adoption**: Focus on smooth UX and clear onboarding
2. **Seller payouts**: Manual review process for high-value transactions
3. **Dispute resolution**: Clear policies and admin tools

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All critical paths tested and working
- [ ] < 2s page load times
- [ ] 100% mobile responsive
- [ ] Zero critical security issues
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

## Timeline Summary
- **Week 1**: Core implementation (Phases 1-4)
- **Week 2**: Polish and deployment (Phases 5-6)
- **Total**: 10-12 days to production

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Regenerate TypeScript types from Supabase
2. Fix type mismatches in components
3. Complete order details page
4. Fix messaging API endpoints

This plan ensures systematic completion of remaining features while maintaining code quality and following established patterns.
